# starcoordinatesplugin
A Kibana plugin to make star coordinates visualizations.

This plugin is for my second final project in Rey Juan Carlos University.

A star coordinates visualization is that one which shows data with n characteristics in a 2 dimensions system.
The data is transformed from n dimensions to two and set on a coordinate system, so the visualisation turns out like so:

![Image of example](https://github.com/ElenaMateos193/starcoordinatesplugin/blob/master/Images/example.png)

In this example, each point represents one row of the data table and each axis is one of the characteristics. If we increase or decrease any axis length or its positions in the system, the points will change its positions, according to the characteristic of the transformed axis.
